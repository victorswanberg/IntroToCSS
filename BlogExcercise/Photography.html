    <h2>The Mansion</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        Insidious is blind inception
        What's reality with all these questions?
        Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in (slept in)
        Broken legs but I chase perfection
        These walls are my blank expression
        My mind is a home I'm trapped in
        And it's lonely inside this mansion
    </p>
    <p>
        Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
        They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
        Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
        And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
        That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
        And let out the version of NF you don't want to see
        I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
        You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
        Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't want to be in
        That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't want to see it
        And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't want to see 'em
        But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
        I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
        Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
        Matter of fact I think I'm a burn this room right now
        So now this memory for some reason just won't come down
        You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
        Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
        Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
        But I'mma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
    </p>
    <p>
        Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
        See my problem is I don't fix things
        I just try to repaint, cover em up, like it never happened
        Say I wish I could change. Are you confused?
        Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
        This room's full of regrets, just keeps getting fuller it seems
        The moment I walk in to it is the same moment that I wanna leave
        I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
        But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
        I look around. One of the worst things I wrote on these walls
        Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
        And one of the first things I wrote was "I wish I would've called"
        But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
        And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
        And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
        Shrug it off like it ain't nothing like it's out of my hands
        Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
        And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
        And at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die
        Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
        The question is: Will I ever clean the walls off in time?
    </p>

        So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
        I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
        'Cause if I do, there's a chance
        That they might disappear and not come back
        And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
        So I just leave my doors locked
        You might get other doors to open up but this doors not
        'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
        And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
        I'm barricaded inside
        So stop watching
        I'm not coming to the door
        So stop knocking, stop knocking
        I'm trapped here
        God keep saying I'm not locked in
        I chose this
        I am lost in my own conscience
        I know that shutting the world out ain't solving the problem
        But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
        I built it because I thought that it would be safer in there
        But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
        Fear came to my house years ago I let 'em in
        Maybe that's the problem
        'Cause I've been dealing with this ever since
        I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
        He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
        Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
        Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
        'Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
        Is that me or the fear talking?
        I don't know anymore

        You and I—we've been through a lot together. And I look back and I just—uh—I appreciate all the times that we had
        together. You know? I remember just going down in my room and—you know—dealing—tryna deal with some things. And you've
        always been there for that. Always, just me and you
    </p>
    <p>
        You and I been best friends ever since I was a young kid
        Everything we did, where has time went?
        Got a lot of years coming up ahead of us and ever since we met
        I knew we'd get somewhere
        But the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when
        I don't really know how either
        But I can feel the goosebumps my skin, writin'
        
        I've been waiting for the moment
        You and I can make it happen
        Lot of people think we ain't gon' make it rapping
        I ain't got a problem with 'em though they don't even matter
        We ain't looking for the people tryna say that we the baddest
    </p>
    <p>
    No, I never liked that
    Came a long way never did it for the money
    We ever make it big, I'm 'a give it to the family
    Looking back now everything is lookin' funny
    
    You and I in the room writing
    Up late when the mood strikes us
    We don't care if they do like us
    Writing songs for the haters we ain't even got yet
    Free-styling. Somebody turn the mic up
    
    Talking 'bout things we don't really understand
    Talking 'bout things we don't really comprehend
    Me and you tryna get it we ain't quitting 'til the end
    Now I'm standing on stage tryna give it to the fans
    </p>
    <p>
        We took that karaoke machine from my room and—ah. We—we put it up to the CD player and played the instrumentals
        Man, we've come a long way, a long way
        
        I made a lot of mistakes
        You've been there for the whole thing
        Help me with the drama
        Rapping in the car outside daily
        We don't care if it's the winter
        We don't care if it's the summer
        
        I remember writing raps with the curse words
        I just wanna hear it, seems like everybody does it
        Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
        Tried to find who I was
        Being everything I wasn't
        Real life yeah!
        
        Got a lot of anger
        You know where I'm at
        Put it all over the pages
        And wrote it into raps,
        Said that we could be amazing
        If I give us a chance
        Now I'm looking round like, "Yeah, look at where we at"
        Look at where we at now we ain't made it yet
        But they can hear us in the background coming
        Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
        I'm 'a put it in His hands and let God do the judging, yeah
        
        Remember me and you always had you in the backpack
        Took you into school
        Writing on you like it's not a lot of people in the room
        See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue
        Nah they ain't got a clue,
        
        We're at the beginning hoping someday you and I can say
        We made it and we did it
        You ain't nothing but a notepad to me,
        Who you kidding?
        I'm just running out of space I'll be back in a minute
        Turn the page, homie
        
        You know what's crazy is? This just started as something that was an escape for us. You know? And now I look around and
        there's a lot of people out there going through the same things—you know?—we've been through. Now this music we write is
        actually making an impact. It's crazy
