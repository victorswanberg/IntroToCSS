THE SYNTAX

If you have a selector and then another selector after it the style will be overwritten.

EDD: "Error Driven Development" is a pun on Test Driven Development. So besides writing tests, you should
more importantly, write errors! And by errors I mean that the program should "throw" an error when something is wrong. 

A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.

User-action pseudo classes

Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. These user-action pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as dynamic pseudo-classes, act as if a class had been added to the element when the user interacts with it. Examples include:

:hover — mentioned above; this only applies if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link.
:focus — only applies if the user focuses the element using keyboard controls.
